# BrainGamma40Hz

**BrainGamma40Hz** is an iOS app designed to promote mental well-being through rhythmic light stimulation and audio, leveraging alpha (8–12 Hz) and gamma (30–40 Hz) frequencies to support relaxation, focus, and cognitive enhancement. It offers a simple, immersive experience with customizable sessions, HealthKit integration for logging Mindful Minutes, and safety-focused instructions.

⚠️ **Warning**: This app uses flashing lights that may trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy (approximately 3–5% of epilepsy patients). Consult a doctor before use if you have epilepsy or are sensitive to light.

## Features

- **Customizable Sessions**: Choose session durations (10–30 minutes), frequencies (8–40 Hz, including alpha and gamma ranges), and strobe patterns (Steady, Burst, Transitioning).
- **Audio Integration**: Includes meditative audio tracks to enhance the experience.
- **Instructional Views**: Guides users to position the device 10–20 cm from their eyes in a dark environment for optimal effect and keep eyes closed during sessions.
- **HealthKit Integration**: Logs sessions as Mindful Minutes in the iOS Health app.
- **About Section**: Provides scientific context and safety information within the app.
- **Background Support**: Continues strobe and audio playback when the screen is locked or the app is in the background, with the screen kept on during sessions to ensure precision.

## The Science Behind BrainGamma40Hz

BrainGamma40Hz uses rhythmic light stimulation to entrain brain waves, potentially promoting relaxation and cognitive benefits. Key concepts include:

- **Alpha Frequencies (8–12 Hz)**: Research suggests alpha stimulation fosters relaxed focus, meditative states, and visual phenomena like phosphenes, which may reduce anxiety and enhance creativity [1].
- **Gamma Frequencies (30–40 Hz)**: Studies, such as those from MIT (2016–2019), indicate 40Hz gamma stimulation may enhance neural synchronization, potentially improving cognition and mood, and inducing hypnagogic phenomena [2, 3].
- **Rhythmic Stimulation**: Consistent, rhythmic light pulses are more effective at entraining brain waves compared to arrhythmic patterns, amplifying therapeutic effects [4].

## Safety Considerations

Approximately 3–5% of individuals with epilepsy are photosensitive and may be at risk from strobe lights. To minimize risks:
- Use the app in a dark environment with eyes closed.
- Position the device 10–20 cm from your eyes (e.g., on your chest while lying down or in front while sitting).
- Consult a doctor if you have epilepsy, photosensitivity, or other medical conditions.

## Privacy

**BrainGamma40Hz does not collect, store, or transmit any user data**. The app uses HealthKit to log Mindful Minutes locally on your device, with your explicit permission. No personal information is shared with third parties or collected by the app, in compliance with Apple’s App Store privacy requirements.


## Usage

1. Launch the app and review the warning screen.
2. In the main view, select:
   - **Duration**: 10–30 minutes.
   - **Frequency**: 8–40 Hz (alpha or gamma).
   - **Pattern**: Steady, Burst, or Transitioning.
   - **Music**: Alpha Meditation or Gamma Focus.
3. Tap **Start** and follow instructional views (positioning, eyes closed).
4. The session runs with precise strobe timing and audio, even when the screen is locked.
5. Check logged sessions in the Health app (**Browse > Mental Wellbeing > Mindful Minutes**).
6. Tap **About** for scientific context and safety information.
