            <strong>Important Safety Notice:</strong> BrainGamma40Hz uses strobe lights that flicker at 40Hz, which may pose a risk for individuals with photosensitive epilepsy or other light-sensitive conditions. Please consult a healthcare professional before using this app. Discontinue use if you experience discomfort, dizziness, or other adverse effects.
        </div>

        <h2>About BrainGamma40Hz</h2>
        <p>BrainGamma40Hz is a simple iOS application designed to support mental well-being through guided strobe light sessions. Inspired by research on brainwave entrainment, the app uses your device's flashlight to deliver a 40Hz flickering light pattern, which may promote relaxation and focus. Choose a session duration between 10 and 30 minutes and experience a calming light-based session.</p>

        <h2>How to Use BrainGamma40Hz</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the app on your iPhone.</li>
            <li>Select a session duration (10 to 30 minutes).</li>
            <li>Ensure your device's flashlight is enabled and place the device in a comfortable position.</li>
            <li>Start the session and relax as the flashlight strobes at 40Hz.</li>
            <li>For best results, use in a dimly lit room and focus gently on the light.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>Why does the app require flashlight access?</h3>
        <p>The app uses your device's flashlight to create the 40Hz strobe effect, which is central to the experience. Ensure flashlight permissions are enabled in your device settings.</p>

        <h3>What should I do if the flashlight doesn’t work?</h3>
        <p>
            - Check that flashlight permissions are enabled in Settings > BrainGamma40Hz.<br>
            - Ensure your device is not in low-power mode, as this may disable the flashlight.<br>
            - Restart the app or your device and try again.
        </p>

        <h3>Is the app safe for everyone?</h3>
        <p>The app includes a strobe light feature that may not be suitable for individuals with photosensitive epilepsy or other sensitivities to flashing lights. Please read the safety notice above and consult a doctor if unsure.</p>

        <h3>Can I adjust the strobe frequency?</h3>
        <p>Currently, the app is set to a fixed 40Hz frequency, based on research into brainwave entrainment. Future updates may include customizable settings.</p>

        <h2>The Science Behind BrainGamma40Hz</h2>
        <p>BrainGamma40Hz uses rhythmic light stimulation to entrain brain waves, potentially promoting relaxation and cognitive benefits. Users can adjust light intensity (10–100%) to balance effectiveness and comfort. Key concepts include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alpha Frequencies (8–12 Hz):</strong> Research suggests alpha stimulation promotes relaxed focus and meditative states, often inducing visual phenomena like phosphenes. Moderate intensity (20–50%) can reduce anxiety and enhance creativity [1].</li>
            <li><strong>Gamma Frequencies (30–40 Hz):</strong> Studies, such as those from MIT (2016–2019), indicate 40Hz gamma stimulation at higher intensity (50–100%) may enhance neural synchronization, potentially improving cognition and mood [2, 3].</li>
            <li><strong>Rhythmic Stimulation:</strong> Consistent, rhythmic light pulses are more effective at entraining brain waves compared to arrhythmic patterns, with intensity influencing neural response strength [4].</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Safety Considerations</h2>
        <p>Approximately 3–5% of individuals with epilepsy are photosensitive and may be at risk from strobe lights. To minimize risks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adjust light intensity to a comfortable level (10–100%).</li>
            <li>Use the app in a dark environment with eyes closed.</li>
            <li>Position the device 10–20 cm from your eyes (e.g., on your chest while lying down or in front while sitting).</li>
            <li>Consult a doctor if you have epilepsy, photosensitivity, or other medical conditions.</li>
        </ul>
