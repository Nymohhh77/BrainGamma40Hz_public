            <strong>Important Safety Notice:</strong> BrainGamma40Hz uses strobe lights that flicker at variable frequencies. Please consult a healthcare professional before using this app if you have photosensitivity issues. Discontinue use if you experience discomfort, dizziness, or other adverse effects.
        </div>

        <h2>About BrainGamma40Hz</h2>
        <p>BrainGamma40Hz is a simple iOS application designed to support relaxation through guided strobe light sessions. Inspired by research on brainwave entrainment, the app uses your device's flashlight to deliver flickering light pattern. The Brain Gamma 40 Hertz app gives you access to a quick brain boost! Choose a session duration between 10 and 30 minutes and experience a calming light-based session.</p>

        <h2>How to Use BrainGamma40Hz</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the app on your iPhone.</li>
            <li>Select a session duration (10 to 30 minutes).</li>
            <li>Ensure your device's flashlight is enabled and place the device in a comfortable position.</li>
            <li>Start the session and relax as the flashlight strobes</li>
            <li>For best results, use in a dimly lit room and focus gently on the light with your eyes always closed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        
        <h3>What should I do if the flashlight doesn’t work?</h3>
        <p>
            - Ensure your device is not in low-power mode, as this may disable the flashlight.<br>
            - Restart the app or your device and try again.
        </p>

        <h3>Is the app safe for everyone?</h3>
        <p>The app includes a strobe light feature that may not be suitable for individuals with sensitivities to flashing lights. Please read the safety notice above and consult a doctor if unsure.</p>

        <h3>Can I adjust the strobe frequency and intensity?</h3>
        <p>Yes you can. </p>

        <h2>The Science about strobe light</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alpha Frequencies (8–12 Hz):</strong> Research suggests alpha stimulation promotes relaxed focus and meditative states, often inducing visual phenomena like phosphenes. Moderate intensity (20–50%) can reduce anxiety and enhance creativity [1].</li>
            <li><strong>Gamma Frequencies (30–40 Hz):</strong> Studies, such as those from MIT (2016–2019), indicate 40Hz gamma stimulation at higher intensity (50–100%) may enhance neural synchronization, potentially improving cognition and mood [2, 3].</li>
            <li><strong>Rhythmic Stimulation:</strong> Consistent, rhythmic light pulses are more effective at entraining brain waves compared to arrhythmic patterns, with intensity influencing neural response strength [4].</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Safety Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Adjust light intensity to a comfortable level (10–100%).</li>
            <li>Use the app in a dark environment with eyes closed.</li>
            <li>Position the device 10–20 cm from your eyes (e.g., on your chest while lying down or in front while sitting).</li>
            <li>Consult a doctor if you have photosensitivity, or other medical conditions.</li>
